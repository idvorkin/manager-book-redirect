# The manager book redirect

## Current Deployment

**âœ¨ New Modal Service**: https://idvorkin--igor-blog-fastapi-app.modal.run

**ðŸ“œ Legacy Azure Functions**: https://idvorkin.azurewebsites.net (still available but deprecated)

**NOTE:** This used to be done with azure funtions. That's FaaS which is great, but if you're doing FaaS, I highly recommend using the much simpler modal. I'm starting that in 2024-04-20.

**UPDATE 2025**: Migrated to Modal! The new service is faster, more reliable, and easier to deploy. The legacy Azure Functions service is still available for backwards compatibility.

---

**NOTE** This used to only redirect to the manager book (thus the name). Now it redirects to any page on the blog

## Why

I'd like to share links to [my blog ](https://idvork.in/), and have the url preview have a title match the header name. (The title is set from the meta tage `og:title`.)

But, the blog is markdown file hosted on Jekyll, a static web site. This means the manager book can only set `og:title` statically.

## How

### Markdown save time

Conveniently, markdown editors create a table of contents by changing headers to anchors. So if you have a `### Section title` that would be encoded as `https://base-url#section-title`.

### Browser Runtime

We can make a service that converts a path to an HTML page with a dynamic `og:title`, and then does a redirect to the path.

### Copy URL time

You need to modify the copied URL from the manager book, which you can do with this oneliner in my [zshrc](https://github.com/idvorkin/Settings/commit/239ba34ccf0ca79c2e6e7c961ca94ebaa9972fbb):

**For Modal (current):**
`alias mb="pbpaste | sed  's!idvork.in/!idvorkin--igor-blog-fastapi-app.modal.run/!'| sed 's!#!/!' | pbcopy"`

**For Azure Functions (legacy):**
`alias mb="pbpaste | sed  's!idvork.in/!idvorkin.azurewebsites.net/!'| sed 's!#!/!' | pbcopy"`

### Deployment + Hosting

#### Current: Modal (Recommended)

The service is deployed to Modal at **https://idvorkin--igor-blog-fastapi-app.modal.run**

Deploy using:

```bash
just deploy
```

Other Modal commands:

- `just serve` - Run locally with Modal
- `just logs` - View deployment logs

#### Legacy: Azure Functions (Deprecated)

This webservice is also deployed to an azure function at https://idvorkin.azurewebsites.net via git hook. Include a path to be converted to the title and anchor link.

Pushing to main deploys to https://manager-book-dev.azurewebsites.net

Pushing to deploy-prod deploys to https://idvorkin.azurewebsites.net

### Keep warm scirpt

Becauses this is an azure function, it has cold starts, to avoid these, run [keepwarm.sh](https://github.com/idvorkin/manager-book-redirect/blob/master/keepwarm.sh) in the background

## Development Setup

This project uses `just` as a command runner and `uv` for Python environment and package management. Pre-commit hooks are configured for automated linting and formatting.

### Initial Setup

1.  Ensure you have `just` and `uv` installed.
    - `just`: See [installation instructions](https://github.com/casey/just#installation).
    - `uv`: See [installation instructions](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation).
2.  Set up the Python virtual environment and install dependencies (defined in `pyproject.toml`):
    ```bash
    just install
    ```
3.  Activate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
4.  Install pre-commit hooks:
    ```bash
    pre-commit install
    ```

### Running Tests

The project includes comprehensive testing with both unit tests and end-to-end tests:

- **Unit tests** (test against local FastAPI instance):
  ```bash
  just test
  ```
- **E2E tests** (test against deployed Modal service):
  ```bash
  just e2e-test
  ```
- **All tests** (unit + E2E):
  ```bash
  just test-all
  ```
- **Fast tests** (unit tests only, used by pre-commit):
  ```bash
  just fast-test
  ```

All tests run in parallel using `pytest-xdist` for faster execution.

### Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks are configured to automatically lint and format code using tools like Ruff (Python), Biome (JSON), and Prettier (Markdown/HTML). These hooks will run automatically when you commit changes. You can also run them manually on all files:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```
